I am thinking about giving up, I have started reading about other people doing this kind of project and I found an article here:

Their conclusion is the following: 

Conclusion:
We can observe that the accuracy achieved by the state-of-the-art ML model is no better than simply guessing with a probability of 50%. Possible reasons for this may be the lack of data or using a very simple model to perform such a complex task as Stock Market prediction.

This aligs with my findings where state of the art models, they also suggested XGBClassifier are not able to effectively predict the price with a probability higher than 50%. 

As a beginner in machine learning and AI I will consider this a good try and move over to proven use cases where its actually possible to get some decent results with simple models.
