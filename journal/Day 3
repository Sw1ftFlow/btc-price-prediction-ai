After spending day 1 setting up the model and day 2 automating and fine tuning the output I was happy to return back to the office to evaluate the models result.

I let it the model run continously after leaving work yesterday so it has been predicting for a good 16 hours now. 

To my disaapointment the results were not very good. In fact they were really bad. 

In 16/19 predictions on what the price would be in the next hour the model was wrong. 

I realized in order for this model to be somewhat useful and atleast generate an above 50% accurate prediction, something had to change. 

I decided to focus on predicting the direction of the market/price as my main objective. This meant I needed to make a change in model to a classification model instead of a regressor. I also decided to add a bunch more features that are relevant. To be continued.
